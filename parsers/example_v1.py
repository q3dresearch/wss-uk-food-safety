"""EXAMPLE PARSER for schema_id `example.v1` — copy, edit, delete this one.

A parser is a pure function of the archived response bytes. It runs at derive
time, never at capture time, so a bug here is fixed by bumping
PARSER_VERSION and re-parsing the archive — never by re-fetching a page that
has since changed.

The workflows auto-discover every module in this package, so adding a parser
needs no workflow edit. Locally:

    wss derive --parsers parsers.example_v1
