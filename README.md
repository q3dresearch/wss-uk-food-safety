# wss-food-hygiene — UK Food Hygiene Ratings

<!-- TODO: one paragraph. What does this capture, and why would the history
     otherwise be lost? The "why" is the reason anyone will care: name the
     window the publisher exposes (rolling counts, current status, today's
     listing) and the fact that uncaptured days are gone for good. -->

A GitHub Actions pipeline that captures UK Food Hygiene Ratings **every day** and publishes
it here as clean, append-only CSVs.

## The data you get

The files to query are `derived/observations/<YYYY-MM>.csv` — one row per
entity, per metric, per day:

```
series_id, entity_id, observed_at, captured_at, metric, value, unit, source_id, raw_ref, parser_version
```

- `entity_id` — the thing being measured
- `observed_at` / `captured_at` — when the fact was true / when we saw it
- `raw_ref` — the archived response the row was parsed from, so every number
  is checkable back to bytes

```bash
head derived/observations/*.csv            # no tooling required
python examples/load_observations.py       # sqlite + example queries
duckdb -c "SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('derived/observations/*.csv') LIMIT 5"
```

## Coverage

Date ranges are machine-readable in [health/health.csv](health/health.csv)
(`first_success_at` → `last_success_at`, updated each run).

| series | what it lists | covered since | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _add a row per source_ | | | ongoing |

Rules for this table: a **new series** gets a row with the date coverage
starts; a **discontinued series** keeps its row with a *covered until* date
and status *discontinued* — its data stays in the repo forever. Nothing
already published is removed.

## What you can build from it

<!-- TODO: the end products. Trend curves, leaderboards, survival analysis,
     divergence between attention and usage — whatever this domain supports. -->

## How it runs

Three scheduled workflows a day — capture (22:10 UTC), health (23:40),
derive (00:20) — powered by the
[wss](https://github.com/q3dresearch/wss) engine, pinned to one
version. No workflow ever names a source: capture shards whatever
`registry/` marks active, so infrastructure never changes when sources do.
The bot commits **data only** — it never changes code; the one config it may
touch is flipping a repeatedly-failing source to `auto_disabled`, with an
issue explaining why.

## Adding a source

1. Add `registry/<source_id>.yml` (copy the example entry), `status: paused`.
2. Add a parser in `parsers/` if the payload shape is new.
3. `wss doctor <source_id>` — **read the raw response**.
4. Flip to `status: active`, add a Coverage row, commit.

Nothing else. No workflow edits, ever.

## Run it locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export WSS_CONTACT="you@example.com"   # identifies you to publishers

wss validate
wss doctor <source_id>
wss capture --cadence monthly
wss derive --parsers parsers.<module>
wss health --dry-run
```

## Going live

1. Push this repo **and the engine repo** under the same GitHub owner
   (`q3dresearch`) — the workflows install the engine from
   `github.com/q3dresearch/wss` at the pinned tag.
2. Set the repo secret **`WSS_CONTACT`** — capture refuses to run
   without it.
3. Run `capture-weekly` once by hand (Actions → capture-weekly → Run
   workflow), confirm the bot's data commit lands, then let the cron take
   over.

## Licences

Two separate files, on purpose: code is MIT ([LICENSE](LICENSE)); data
(`raw/`, `manifest/`, `derived/`) is CC-BY-4.0
([LICENSE-DATA](LICENSE-DATA)), citation in [CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff).
Captured content remains subject to the publisher's own terms.
